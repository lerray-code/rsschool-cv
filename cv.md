## Summaru

I am a third year student at BSUIR. The second semester is almost over. I don't feel that I am growing day by day. This is the main reason why I decided to try something new (RS school). I hope my hard work and the course will help me gain useful knowledge.
My goal is to learn new and interesting things. I like to code, I can spend a lot of time on things that interest me. My strengths are problem solving and fast learning. I want to acquire enough knowledge and skills to get a job in a company.
I am interested in web development because in this profession there are endless opportunities for professional development,
There are also many free, high-quality resources for self-study and a great developer community.
I believe that the ability to learn and acquire new skills will lead me to become a skilled front-end developer.
